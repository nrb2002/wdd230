    <p>
        I'm from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, father of two beautiful daughters - the oldest is 19 and the youngest is 6. My wife and I served
        a full-time mission respectively in Lubumbashi, DRC and in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. The two of us are members of both our ward and stake choirs.
        Because of that influence, our two daughters joined the same choirs. I feel like I love anything that has a keyboard and requires creativity and discipline,
        like computers and pianos. I'm a self-taught pianist.

        I joined this class because I'm about to change my career and become a professional software developer. FYI, I graduated in software development 
        about three years ago. So, I'm looking forward to learning from all of you!
