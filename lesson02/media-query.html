                <p>For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have crejected the prophets, 
                    and Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my father, 
                    insomuch that they have driven him out of the land.

                <p>And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, 
                    and the bother is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God 
                    belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.
