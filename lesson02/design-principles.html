        Choose three (3) of principles from the following list of design topics on which to present and find examples.
            Visual Hierarchy
            Hick's Law
            Fitt's Law
            Rule of Thirds
            White Space and Clean Design
            PARC: Proximity
            PARC: Alignment
            PARC: Repetition
            PARC: Contrast

        For each of the principles that you selected you will need to provide (see screenshot examples below):
            the design principle,
            the organization/company's name,
            the web site address as a external hyperlink,
            a mobile view screenshot of an organization's web page that, in your opinion, illustrates that principle, and
            a brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on that page.

                        NASA website uses a good visual design, color and contrast that creates visual hierarchy on the page. 
                        Some elements appear to be more important than others. That helps determine what grabs the user's attention first 
                        and what level of importance is assigned to various design elements. The contrast in value and saturation creates 
                        the visual hierarchy. For example, the colors for both the font and the background of the "Learn more" button 
                        suggest that the user should read these recent articles as they promotes recent NASA achievements.

                        The rule of thirds is a method of dividing an image or drawing into different sections using columns and rows to form a grid. The grid consists of three rows and columns evenly spaced to form nine equal squares that fit the image. 
                        This site integrates the rule of thirds perfectly into its home page. The image is aligned in such a way as to capture the user's attention while giving an impression of fluidity, unlike symmetrical designs, which suggest immobility and rigidity. In other words, the image isn't necessarily centered but located in the right spot to grab the user's attention at first glance.

                        The MIT website is a good illustration of white space and clean design. It's visually easy to navigate with a simple, clutter-free design. The benefits of this design style include a clear, consistent color palette, plenty of negative space, intuitive navigation, simple typography, and above all, faster site page display.
