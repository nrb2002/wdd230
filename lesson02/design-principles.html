    <!--
        Choose three (3) of principles from the following list of design topics on which to present and find examples.
            Visual Hierarchy
            Hick's Law
            Fitt's Law
            Rule of Thirds
            White Space and Clean Design
            PARC: Proximity
            PARC: Alignment
            PARC: Repetition
            PARC: Contrast

        For each of the principles that you selected you will need to provide (see screenshot examples below):
            the design principle,
            the organization/company's name,
            the web site address as a external hyperlink,
            a mobile view screenshot of an organization's web page that, in your opinion, illustrates that principle, and
            a brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on that page.

                        According to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-hierarchy-ux-definition/#:~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20visual%20hierarchy%20of,Scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Nielsen Norman Group,</a>
                        the visual hierarchy of a 2D display (webpage, graphic, print, etc.) refers to the organization of the design elements 
                        on the page so that the eye is guided to consume each design element in the order of intended importance.

                        NASA website uses a good visual design, color and contrast that creates visual hierarchy on the page. 
                        Some elements appear to be more important than others. That helps determine what grabs the user's attention first and 
                        what level of importance is assigned to various design elements. The contrast in value and saturation creates the visual
                        hierarchy. For example, the colors for both the font and the background of the "Learn more" button suggest that the user 
                        should read these recent articles as they promotes recent NASA achievements.
