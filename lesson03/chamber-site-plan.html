                Site Name: This is the name of the site normally based upon the locale and purpose. 
                A representative domain that is available to purchase would be normally important but not required in this class. 
                Provide a valid site name that is relevant to the locale. 
                Include the word "Chamber" in the site name and a short reason why the the site name was selected.
                Example: Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce. This name represents a city in which the chamber operates.

                Site Purpose: The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing what services and information 
                will be provided. 
                The client typically drives this content by stating functional specifications. 
                It is OK to be less formal than this given example. 
                Provide at least two purposes for having the website developed and running.
                Example: "The Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce acts as a regional economic catalyst, leadership convener and community champion. 
                We promote business through member services, economic and community development, and public policy that balances economic 
                prosperity" - carlsbad.org site description

            <h2>Site purpose</h2>
            <div>
                <p>We promote entrepreneurship and defend the rights of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises operating in Kinshasa. 
                    We also advocate for an improved business environment while contributing to the local economy's health by increasing GDP and 
                    reducing unemployment through job creation.. 
                </p>

                <p>We are therefore the platform par excellence that not only connects, leads, inspires, and advocates for communities of local entrepreneurs, but also 
                    helps them meet the challenges of innovation.

                • What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking?
